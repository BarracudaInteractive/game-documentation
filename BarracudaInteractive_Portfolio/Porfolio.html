        <p class="center s24px">We are glad to present you to Rally Team Tactics, aslo refered as RTT. RTT is our current proyect, and we are giving everything we can and more to finish it and give you the best game experiencie. But, I am sure you are asking know, what is RTT? Let's find out.</p>
        <p class="center s24px">RTT is not an usual racing game. In RTT you will control a former pilot who lost his right leg during a rally race accident. Unable to race again, he decided to teach the new rally pilot generation.</p>
        <p class="center s24px">Instead of being an ordinary race game, you will have to give instruction to the young pilot in this puzzle turn-based race game. The race is divided in checkpoints, and you will have to give instuctions to the pilot, trying to finish before emptying the deposit or destrying the car. Use your intelect to find out the best way to finish the race the fatest way posible.</p>
