				<h1 class="center s48px">Rally Team Tactics (RTT)</h1>
				<p class="center s24px">We are currenty developing our first game, Rally Team Tactics, also known as RTT. 
					RTT is our first attempt to break into the industry, and we are putting our heart and soul into it. Want to know more about the game? 
					Let us offer you a glimspe of the concept behind it:</p>
				<p class="center s24px">RTT is not a regular racing game. Here you will take control of a former pilot who lost his right leg during a rally race accident. 
					Unable to compete again, he decides to become a mentor for aspiring rally racers.</p>
				<p class="center s24px">Instead of directly controlling the vehicle, you will be tasked with analyzing the track and giving instructions as a copilot.
					Trial and error are key in this turn-based racing game as finding out the best strategy might take a few attempts. 
					Keeping the vehicle in the road while watching over the levels of damage and fuel might sound difficult, but RTT gives players the neccesary guidance to understand the systems and ultimately master them to set the best times in the leaderboards.</p>
				<p class="center s24px">Eager to know more?
					Keep an eye on our socials to be updated on the development and launch of the game!</p>
